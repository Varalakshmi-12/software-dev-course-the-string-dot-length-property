/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
console.log(stringOne.length);
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
console.log(stringTwo.length);
let stringThree = "";
console.log(stringThree.length);

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne =15;   // Length of stringOne
let lengthTwo =10;   // Length of stringTwo
let lengthThree =0; // Length of stringThree
